</head>
<body>
  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Nickname:
      <span id="nickname"></span>
    </li>
    <li>Favorites:
      <span id="favorites"></span>

1. (In JavaScript) Change the body tag's style so it has a font-family of "Arial, sans-serif".
1. (In JavaScript) Replace the content of each of the spans (nickname, favorites, hometown) with your own information.
1. Iterate through each li and add a class of "listitem". Add a style tag that sets a rule for "listitem" to make the color red.
1. Create a new img element and set its src attribute to a picture of you. Append that element to the body.
