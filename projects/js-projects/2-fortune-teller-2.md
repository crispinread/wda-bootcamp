# The Fortune Teller: With Functions!
Let's turn one of the Class 1 Exercises into a function.

1. Write a function named `tellFortune` that:
    * takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
    * outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
1. Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
