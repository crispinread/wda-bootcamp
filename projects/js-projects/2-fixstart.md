# FixStart
Create a function called `fixStart`. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with '*****', except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:

```
fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'
fixStart('turtle'): 'tur*le'
```
