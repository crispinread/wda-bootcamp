# Challenge Question: String Manipulation
If you feel comfortable with the other exercises, it's time to expand your knowledge! These puzzles involve manipulating strings; to try them out, you'll need to use some of the [built-in JavaScript methods for strings](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp). Methods are pre-written functions that are built into the language.

These questions are not as straightforward as the others. They challenge you to really think like a programmer. Really try to solve them before you peek at the answer.

## MixUp
Create a function called `mixUp`. It should take in two strings, and return the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long. For example:
```
mixUp('mix', 'pod'): 'pox mid'
mixUp('dog', 'dinner'): 'dig donner'
```
