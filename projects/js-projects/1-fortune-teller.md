# The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

1. Store the following into variables:
    * number of children
    * partner's name
    * geographic location
    * job title
2. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
