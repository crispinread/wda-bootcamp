### Copyright Challenge
Create a program to provide an up to date copyright statement that could be used in the footer of a website. You could add this to your profile page or Wordpress blog - or both.

1. Make sure that the year is current
1. Use the HTML code to display the copyright symbol
1. Ensure the word ‘copyright’ appears
In addition please take a look at the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** project on Free Code Camp:

### Jim's Code Test

Create a modular scalable system for working out the average from the array below. (Please copy it
exactly)

[3,7,'df','3',7,8,'df',23,6,2,67,'g','34',12,34,5]

The answer should be 16.2307692

With a very simple frontend that displays the items in a box with an interactive element to activate the calculation and display it below, when clicked the number will appear below. The frontend should just have HTML and some CSS generated from SCSS and the javascript should be vanilla (no libraries).

Colours that should be included:
* Brand1 – #00585E
* Brand2 - #009494
* Brand3 - #F5F2DC
* Brand4 - #454445
* Brand5 - #FF5729

Detail is important, so it's a small task, but the detail could be enhanced with additional code for ensuring the stability of parts of the system.

It doesn't need to look particularly good (design) as it's more about the coding standards and
maintainability.

For extra points, [fork this repo](https://github.com/wdanuk/wda-code-test) to your own GitHub account and submit a **pull request** with your solution.
