# The Temperature Converter
Let's make a program to convert celsius tempatures to fahrenheit and vice versa, so we can complain about the weather with our friends oversees.

**Reminder:** To convert celsius to fahrenheit, multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32. To convert fahrenheit to celsius, deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9.

**Unicode Characters:** To print the degrees symbol in JavaScript, we need to use the write \u00B0 to represent the unicode character for the degress symbol.

1. Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
1. Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
1. Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
1. Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
