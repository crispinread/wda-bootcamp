# The Calculator
1. Write a function called `squareNumber` that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
1. Write a function called `halfNumber` that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
1. Write a function called `percentOf` that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
1. Write a function called `areaOfCircle` that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
    * **Bonus:** Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.
1. Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier:
    1. Take half of the number and store the result.
    1. Square the result of #1 and store that result.
    1. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
    1. Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).
