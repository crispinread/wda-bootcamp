## Blog Posts - Tips and Ideas
It is a really good idea to put more than the minimum required number of blog posts or portfolio items on your site. Blog posts do not need to be very long but should always be more than a sentence or two. Here are some tips and ideas for posts:

### Tips
1. **Use short sentences and lists**
1. **Use images in your posts** - Take pictures on your phone, use  [Screengrabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-minus/bnophbnknjcjnbadhhkciahanapffepm?hl=en) or search for [free images](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b)
1. **Embed code** - Employers will want to see that you can write code as well as talk about it, you can embed codepens or paste directly within `<code>` tags - add syntax style if you can to make it easier to read.
1. **...and don't forget the spell checker**
