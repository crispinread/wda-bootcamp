# Create a Blog
Create a blog site to record your progress and showcase your skills. We recommend using Wordpress but there are other options.

## Objective

We want to create a site for you to show to prospective employers. It will act as a CV and portfolio to show them what you have done in the past and what you have learned at this boot-camp.

## Set-Up

1. Login or create an account at [
1. Spin up a new Wordpress installation
1. Follow the install process

### Config

Once Wordpress is installed head to the admin dashboard and fill in some appropriate settings, youâ€™ll want to give it a descriptive title and slogan, maybe add a logo and site icon.

### Set Theme

You could leave the theme as the default or change it to one of the few that it ships with but there are tens of thousands of other themes to choose from. You can find loads of free [themes at wordpress.org](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/) and even more elsewhere on the web.

When choosing a theme remember to look for a responsive one and if it has extra stuff like different post types and widgets make sure they are useful.

## Content

We are looking for a nice front-page explaining who you are and what the site is about and a blog where you can record what you are learning or have done previously. You might want to add a contact form and an about page with more details about your qualifications and experience.
