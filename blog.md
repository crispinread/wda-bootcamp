# Create a Blog
Create a blog site to record your progress and showcase your skills. We recommend using Wordpress but there are other options.

## Objective

We want to create a site for you to show to prospective employers. It will act as a CV and portfolio to show them what you have done in the past and what you have learned at this boot-camp.

## Set-Up

1. Go to yourname.wdan.uk/cpanel
  E.g. crispin.wdan.uk/cpanel
1. Follow the facilitator through the set up process

### Config

Once Wordpress is installed head to the admin dashboard and fill in some appropriate settings, youâ€™ll want to give it a descriptive title and slogan, maybe add a logo and site icon.

### Set Theme

You could leave the theme as the default or change it to one of the few that it ships with but there are tens of thousands of other themes to choose from. You can find loads of free [themes at wordpress.org](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/) and even more elsewhere on the web.

When choosing a theme remember to look for a responsive one and if it has extra stuff like different post types and widgets make sure they are useful.

## Content

We are looking for a nice front-page explaining who you are and what the site is about and a blog where you can record what you are learning or have done previously. You might want to add a contact form and an about page with more details about your qualifications and experience.


## Blog Posts - Tips and Ideas
It is a really good idea to put more than the minimum required number of blog posts or portfolio items on your site. Blog posts do not need to be very long but should always be more than a sentence or two. Here are some tips and ideas for posts:

### Employers will want to see you:
1. Responding to challenges and fixing problems
1. Writing good, clean, well spaced code **with comments**
1. Have a really good grasp of markup
1. Have progressed and learned new things during the bootcamp

### Tips
1. **Use short sentences and lists**
1. **Use images in your posts** - Take pictures on your phone, use  [Screengrabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-minus/bnophbnknjcjnbadhhkciahanapffepm?hl=en) or search for [free images](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b)
1. **Embed code** - Employers will want to see that you can write code as well as talk about it, you can embed codepens or paste directly within `<code>` tags - add syntax style if you can to make it easier to read.
1. **...and don't forget the spell checker**

### Ideas for Posts
1. Daily or Weekly  Record
1. Showcase of a previous piece of work
1. Showcase of a challenge from this bootcamp
1. Key takeouts from Treehouse tracks
1. Key takeouts from Intro to JavaScript
1. How I built my blog, what system I chose and why, what themes I looked at, what I plan to do in the future
1. Content Management
1. Drupal Vs Wordpress
1. Open Source
