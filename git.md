## Description
In this session we'll learn about change management and version control. How it is possible for multiple developers work on the same code at the same time using git as a version control tool. We'll also look at how we can use git to provide a workflow and code review process to make sure we are solving the problems at hand while producing the best code possible.

## Outcomes
At the end of this training you will be able to:

- Install git on your machine
- Understand basic Git commands
- Use command line to work with local and remote git repositories
- Create and manage repositories and collaborators in GitHub
- Use GitHubs 'Pull Request' feature for code reviews
