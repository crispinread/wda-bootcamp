Gather a list of potential companies and organisations from your local area to approach. Five is not enough, you will need to apply to more than 20 places to be in with a chance of finding one who is open to the idea of an apprentice AND ready to hire now. The more companies you approach the better chance you have.

### Web search

Search for web development firms and teams in Manchester. To widen your search click through many pages deep, don’t just pull results from the first page. Also use other search engines like Bing and different search keywords and combinations.

e.g.

* Wordpress London
* Web design London
* Web Agency London
* Web development
* Php London

### Job Boards

Find out who is hiring by looking at job boards - many of the postings will be from recruiters and employment firms but many web development teams will post their own ads as well. Look for people hiring php, Drupal, Wordpress, Magento as these are the things we are best placed to train

* [Indeed](http://www.indeed.co.uk/)
* [Total jobs](https://www.totaljobs.com)
* [Monster](https://www.monster.co.uk/)
* [JobSite](http://www.jobsite.co.uk/)

Finding a company this way also gives you something to add to your cover letter - I saw on Monster that you are looking for an experienced php developer so I’m hoping you would be open to the idea of hiring an apprentice as well.

### Press

Search for web development firms and stories in the local and industry press - this will give you something to talk about at the interview and also in your cover letter:

* The Drum
* The Register

### Meetups and Events

There are always local groups to attend that will connect you to people who can help you find a position - have a look on Eventbright and [MeetUp.com](http://meetup.com)
