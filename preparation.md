Decide who you are going to target and put yourself in their shoes. What do they want to see in a person? What do they want to achieve as a team who do they want to hire and how do you fit in?

### CV

Give your CV a bit of a spruce up - if you don’t have an intro or personal statement it is a good idea to add one. One or two short sentences that describe you and what you want ~ for example:

“Confident/Dedicated/Enthusiastic/Outgoing/Hardworking individual looking to join a web development team as an apprentice. I’ve been making websites for 2 years and / I’ve only been coding for a few weeks but I know this is the career for me/I’d really like to learn skills from the people who actually do the job.

### Cover Letter Template

Write out a draft cover letter - this does not need to be long but it is a great opportunity to express your personality and enthusiasm - it’s a longer version of the personal statement from your CV. It is also important that you talk about the company you are approaching in your letter - more on this in the research section next.

I would say 200 - 400 words would be ideal.
